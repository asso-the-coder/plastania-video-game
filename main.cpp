 *	Name:     Aser Abdelgawad                                                *
 *	Date:     17 January 2020                                                *
 *                                                                           *
 *	Purpose:  Main code for Plastania                                        *
 *	                                                                         *
 *	Usage:  A fun game that is meant to spread awareness regarding the impact*
 *          of plastic waste on our planet; promoting environmental          *
 *          sustainability to combat climate change                          *
 *	                                                                         *
 *	Revision History: Beta release was on 13 January 2020                    *
 *	                                                                         *
 *	Known Issues: When high score is entered, the user is unable to play again
                  due to a random glitch that does not redraw the recycling
                  bin. If this occurs, restart the game

                  Some random mouse positions yield glitchy trajectories. Try
                  to avoid them if possible.
