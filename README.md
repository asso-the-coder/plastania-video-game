Angry Birds-esque video game I made in high school using the Allegro game programming library in C++

To play on a Windows machine, simply run the .exe in the root directory.

PS: In retrospect, the file organization, system design, and programming practices used are wildly amateur. BUT the game is pretty fun, and the indie vibe is strong. Enjoy!
